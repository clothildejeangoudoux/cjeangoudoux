I am currently in a Postdoctoral position in Computer Science at MPI-SWS in Kaiserslautern, Germany. Before that, I did my PhD with Stef Graillat and Christoph Lauter at UPMC in Paris, France and Safran Electronics & Defense.

My research area goes from reliable computer arithmetic and software testing, to numerically reliable neural networks. In my PhD thesis, I tackled the problem of automatic test generation of numerical software for aircraft certification.
